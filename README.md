# Cloud Application Development with Flask, IBM DB2, and IBM Object Storage

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and resources for a cloud-based application developed using Flask as the web framework, IBM DB2 as the database management system, and IBM Object Storage for file storage. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting up and running the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- IBM DB2 (or another compatible database)
- IBM Cloud account with Object Storage (for file storage)
- Any additional dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### Database Configuration

Update the database connection details (e.g., host, username, password) in the `config.py` file.

### IBM Object Storage Configuration

1. Obtain the necessary credentials (API key, endpoint, and resource instance) from your IBM Cloud Object Storage account.

2. Update the Object Storage configuration in `config.py` with your credentials.

## Running the Application

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated (if you created one):

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

3. Access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Usage
